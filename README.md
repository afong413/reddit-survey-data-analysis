# Efficacy of Fact-Checking Sources on Reddit

This is the data and Python code to analyze the data used for my study "Efficacy of Fact-Checking Sources on Reddit." The raw data from Supabase and Prolific should go in `./raw/`. Running `python3 ./preprocess.py` will preprocess and reformat the data into `./data/`. `python3 ./main.py` will apply the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Dunn post-hoc test with Hommel correction to the preprocessed data.
